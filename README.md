### General Info

"My Sci-fi Space" is an intuitive, informational, and entertainment intended hobby website. It has been create for all science fiction lovers out there to find out some information of sci-fi, and invites user interactive participation by offering registration, member-only area sign-in \*\*for the opportunity to upload their own creations to showcase in the site. Users will be able to interact by answering a short survey and giving feedback on each others contributions. Their contributions could be short-stories, short-films, image arts, etc optional comment area will be located under their submissions. Sci-fi enthusiasts will also find more links to other websites sci-fi related. Overall, the purpose and value for the user is to be entertained and have fun.  
My intention on creating this website is to showcase HTML and CSS and related skills acquired while participating on WAES/Code Institure Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The first of three projects schedule in order to complete the bootcamp. This initial project is focused on HTML and CSS skill set.
I have not had the time to make all pages fully responsive, which is the case of 'Trivia' Page due to the table content.
Features to be added 1) Forum with ability to upload content with comments 2) Members only area with ability to comments on members upload. As I intend to basic HTML and CSS website on the second project using JavaScrip to make it fully interactive.

\*\*To be implemented in future release with javascript.
